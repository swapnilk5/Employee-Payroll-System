# Employee-Payroll-System
This Java program models a basic payroll system using object-oriented principles. It defines an abstract Employee class with common attributes like name and id, and an abstract method calculateSalary(). Two concrete classes, FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee, extend Employee and provide specific salary calculation logic.

The PayrollSystem class manages a list of employees, allowing adding, removing, and displaying employee details. In the Main class, the system is tested by creating both full-time and part-time employees, displaying their details, and then removing an employee.

Key features:

> Abstract class with concrete implementations for salary calculation
> Dynamic employee management (add/remove)
> Polymorphism in handling different employee types
